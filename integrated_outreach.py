{copy['personalized_opening']}

I'm Sameera, founder of Outbound - a platform where people book behind-the-scenes experiences at local businesses.

{copy['revenue_hook']}.

Want to see how? I created a personalized revenue calculator just for {business_name}:
ðŸ‘‰ {landing_url}

Takes 2 minutes to see your specific setup analysis and projected earnings.

Many similar businesses are already earning ${intelligence['revenue_projections']['monthly_revenue']:,}/month - they love the effortless additional income while sharing their craft.

Best,
Sameera
