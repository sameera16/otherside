Subject: Raaka Chocolate: Raw chocolate curiosity = $3,200/month opportunity

Hi Raaka Chocolate,

People are endlessly curious about raw chocolate - it's so different from traditional chocolate making. Your unroasted approach is fascinating but people rarely get to just... watch.

I'm Sameera, founder of Otherside. Based on 127 monthly searches for "chocolate making" in Brooklyn, you could earn $3,200/month from observers.

I created a personalized preview for Raaka:
ðŸ‘‰ yourusername.github.io/otherside-landing/raaka-chocolate-preview.html

Shows your specific setup analysis, revenue projections, and local demand proof. Takes 2 minutes to review.

Many artisan businesses are earning $2,000-5,000/month through Otherside - they love the effortless income while sharing their craft.

Interested in a 10-minute chat?

Best,
Sameera
